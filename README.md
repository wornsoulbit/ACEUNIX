This is the repository for the final project. It contains:

- Our entire Jekyll webiste in the jekyll-theme-chirpy directory.
- An auto deployemnt bash script. It gets the current version of the Jekyll site through git, checks if there are any changes, then deploys the current version of website project on to the server (_site)).
- An INSTALL file that has a step-by-step process on how to set up a server.
- Each of our personal dated reports within out respective folder (Alex, Ebra).
